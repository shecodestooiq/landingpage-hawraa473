<p class="p3">“Wool weaving” is one of the oldest traditional crafts in the Arabian Peninsula. It is the craft that gives an honest picture of the efforts of man and women in particular, and their efforts in the first place. Through it, it expresses ancient artistic traditions rooted in the authenticity of history, as women in the Western region excel at crafting.  The “wool” is decorated and engraved with dense engravings, which consist of various geometric shapes and bright colors such as red, blue, and orange. Thus, it reflects an artistic sense, aesthetic taste, and good exploitation of its raw resources from the natural environment and adapting them to one’s advantage.</p>
